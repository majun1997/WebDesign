Build a simple web app for displaying stock data.

1. As a user, I should see an input field where I can enter a comma-separated list of stock symbols.

2. As a user, I should see a submit button and on clicking the submit it should display all the stock details (entered in the input) in a table below.

3. Use this link to fetch stock details, https://api.worldtradingdata.com/api/v1/stock?symbol=SNAP,TWTR,VOD.L&api_token=demo. You can replace the symbol query parameter value with the input field value.

This is a sample for json->web.
